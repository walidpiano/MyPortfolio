# Portfolio
The webpage has a simple portfolio of me. I have tried to make it simple and attractive.
To open the project, just open [index.html](https://github.com/walidpiano/MyPortfolio/blob/master/index.html) :wink: !


## Installation

1. The project has a simple website. It consists of one ```.html``` file and two folders (```img``` & ```css```).
2. You just need to download the files, and then open the main page [index.html](https://github.com/walidpiano/MyPortfolio/blob/master/index.html).

## Application Running:
Note that once you open the [index.html](https://github.com/walidpiano/MyPortfolio/blob/master/index.html):
1. Your webbrowser will open.
2. A fancy fully responsive portfolio will open up.
